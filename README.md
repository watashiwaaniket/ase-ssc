## SortaEcommerce
Sorta ecommerce came alive because of the ASE challenge from `VERTO`

**The Task objective was to build a Simple Shopping Cart which can be accessed from [`here`](https://giddy-runner-f4c.notion.site/ASE-Challenge-278c67fdf6d48038aec8d64bef58f5a4?p=279c67fdf6d48149a9dbf54a9e3a7279&pm=s)**

## Local setup
This is a simple `Nextjs` project which can be run in few simple steps.

First clone the repository using the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/watashiwaaniket/ase-ssc.git
```

Then `cd` into the project folder and install the dependencies
```
cd ase-ssc/
npm install
```

After all the dependencies are fetched, run the project using this command
```
npm run dev
```

The project can now be accessed on
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## How to run Test

Test cases can be run using simple command
```
npm test
```

It uses `Jest` and `supertest` for testing and HTTP requests
Test file can be found in
```
app/(backend)/tests/route.test.ts
```
